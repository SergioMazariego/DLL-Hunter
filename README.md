# DLL Hunter

DLL Hunter is a Python script that scans running processes on a Windows host and identifies instances of specific processes executing DLLs. It helps in the detection and analysis of potentially malicious or suspicious activities by monitoring processes commonly associated with DLL injection or other security-related concerns.

## Features

- Scans running processes and identifies instances of specific processes executing DLLs.
- Supports detection of the following processes: `rundll32.exe`, `regsvr32.exe`, `regsvcs.exe`, `regasm.exe`, `certoc.exe`, `dnscmd.exe`, `installutil.exe`, `mavinject32.exe`, `msiexec.exe`, `netsh.exe`, `pcalua.exe`, `rasautou.exe`, `register-cimprovider.exe`, `acccheckconsole.exe`, `coregen.exe`, `dotnet.exe`, `procdump.exe`, `tracker.exe`, `vsls-agent.exe`, and `wuauclt.exe`.
- Provides the process name, process ID (PID), and the DLL path for further investigation.
- Requires administrative privileges for accurate results.
